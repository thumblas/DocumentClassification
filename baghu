Awright!  Bobby's back, in all of his shit-for-brains glory.  Just
when I thought he'd turned the corner of progress, his Thorazine
prescription runs out.  

I'd put him in my kill file, but man, this is good stuff.  I wish
I had his staying power.

Fortunately, I learned not to take him too seriously long,long,long
ago.

It amazes me that you have the audacity to say that human creation was not
the result of the natural process of evolution (but rather an "act of God")
and then in the same post say that these other processes (volcanos et al.)
are natural occurrences.  Who gave YOU the right to choose what things are
natural processes and what are direct acts of God?  How do you know that
God doesn't cause each and every natural disaster with a specific purpose
in mind?  It would certainly go along with the sadistic nature I've seen in
the bible
